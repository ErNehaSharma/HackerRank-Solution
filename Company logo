solution for this is:

from collections import Counter

company_name = input()

char_count = Counter(company_name)
sorted_chars = sorted(char_count.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))  # Sort by count (descending) and then alphabetically

for i in range(min(3, len(sorted_chars))):  # Print up to three characters or all distinct characters if less than three
    char, count = sorted_chars[i]
    print(char, count)
